## OVERVIEW OF PROJECT "Student Grades and GPA Calculator"

This project is a simple and intuitive application designed to help students manage their grades and calculate their GPA. Built using Python and the Tkinter library, the application provides a user-friendly interface for inputting grades, displaying a summary of grades by subject, and calculating the overall GPA.

### Features:
- **Grade Entry**: Easily add grades for different subjects with input validation to ensure accurate data entry.
- **Grade Summary**: View a detailed summary of all grades entered, organized by subject.
- **GPA Calculation**: Automatically calculates the overall GPA based on the grades entered, along with the corresponding letter grade.
- **Clear Grades**: Allows users to clear all grades and start fresh.

### Key Activities:
- **GUI Development**: Designed a straightforward interface using Tkinter, making the application accessible and easy to use.
- **Grade Management**: Implemented functionality to store, display, and manage grades for different subjects.
- **GPA Calculation**: Developed an algorithm to calculate the GPA based on the grades entered, including error handling for invalid inputs.
- **Testing and Validation**: Conducted rigorous testing to ensure the application performs correctly under various scenarios.

### Technologies Used:
- **Python**: The primary programming language used for developing the application.
- **Tkinter**: Used to create the graphical user interface for the application.
- **Git**: Employed for version control to manage and track changes in the project.

### Key Insights:
- **Input Validation**: Learned the importance of validating user inputs to ensure data integrity.
- **Algorithm Design**: Gained experience in designing algorithms to calculate grades and GPA accurately.
- **User Experience**: Focused on creating a user-friendly interface that simplifies grade management for students.
